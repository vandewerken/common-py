# Common-py

This repo offers a collection of routines that can be incorporated into other python functions and scripts. I've spent a fair amount of time trying to get working functionality for common types of file manipulations and parsing and these are some of what I've come up with. I've already been through the StackOverflow rabbitholes, and these are the most optimal solutions to each of the issues presented. 

I'm releasing under an MIT license, so feel free to clone / modify as necessary. You might find these helpful if you're trying to do file parsing with excel.
